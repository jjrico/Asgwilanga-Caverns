My algorithm works by holding each of the three values the same and changing
the other two until a new room is found.

Best case, the algorithm finds a new room while holdiing the first value the same.
This would be O(N).

Worst case, the algorithm goes through each of the three values in the array and
finds no new rooms. This causes the algorithm to clear the hash table and begin
the function again with the first value. This occurs with O(N^3 + N)

Overall my algorithm runs with an average time complexity of O(N^2) because in most
cases, the algorithm finds a new room on the first try.
